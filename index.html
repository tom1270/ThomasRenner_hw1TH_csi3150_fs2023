          My name is Thomas Renner and I am a senior at Oakland University,
          majoring in Computer Science. I am originally from Germany, so german
          is my first language. I learned to program in high school and enjoyed
          it ever since. I have held multiple internships throughout the years,
          starting in IT, and moving on to a Software Engineering position, and
          lastly, obtaining a System Integration Internship. As an Eagle Scout,
          I have had the privilege to collaborate with and lead a multitude of
          people with vastly different backgrounds. There, I was able to
          demonstrate my ability to motivate and to find creative solutions to
          difficult problems. Having written multiple complex programs, that
          revolve around everyday needs, individually and with a team, I have
          been able to continuously prove these skills in my coding and managing
          of groups. To get to know more about me, visit my
          <a href="./html/my_resume.html">Resume</a> and
          <a href="./html/my_fun_facts.html">Fun Facts</a> pages.

        <h2>Progress Toward Graduation</h2>
        <progress max="128" value="120"></progress>
        <p>
          I have completed 120 course credits out of 128 to get a B.S. degree,
          and will be completing the last 8 this school year.
